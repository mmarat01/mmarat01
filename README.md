### howdy ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ¤ 

Currently working a lot with web technologies ðŸ˜Ž  
...but also writing obscene amounts of C ðŸ˜³

#### some stuff i've done recently:
- Wrote a ppm image compressor and decompressor in C --> learned about the nitty gritty of images, and bitwise operations
- Wrote an Express/MongoDB API for a non-profit's web app (s/o to @JumboCode) --> learned a lot about modern backend programming
- Worked on my personal website using Jekyll (Ruby/Liquid), HTML/CSS --> learning about design and using an SSG
- Built a small website interacting with the GitHub API. --> learned about interacting with public APIs
